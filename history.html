<h3>Development</h3> 



<br>





<h4>The birth of artificial intelligence 1952-1956</h4> 



		<p>
		  In the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields 
		 (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) 
		  began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. 
		  The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. 
		</p>



<br>



<h4>The golden years 1956-1974</h4> 



		<p>
		The years after the Dartmouth conference were an era of discovery, of sprinting across new ground. 
		The programs that were developed during this time were, to most people, simply "astonishing": 
		computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. 
		Few at the time would have believed that such "intelligent" behavior by machines was possible at all. 
		Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, 
		predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. 
		Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field. 
		</p>



<br>

<h4>The first AI winter 1974-1980</h4> 



		<p>
		 In the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. 
					  AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. 
					  Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, 
					  and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. 
					  At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years 
					  by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.
					  Despite the difficulties with public perception of AI in the late 70s, 
					  new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas.
		</p>



<br>

<h4>Boom 1980-1987</h4> 



		<p>
		In the 1980s a form of AI program called "expert systems" was adopted 
					  by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. 
					  In those same years, the Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. 
					  Another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. 
					  Once again, AI had achieved success. 
		</p>



<br>

<h4> Bust: the second AI winter 1987-1993 </h4>
				
					<p>
					  The business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. 
					  The collapse was in the perception of AI by government agencies and investors 
					  – the field continued to make advances despite the criticism. 
					  Rodney Brooks and Hans Moravec, researchers from the related field of robotics, 
					  argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence. 
					</p>
					
<br>
				
<h4> AI 1993-2011 </h4>
				
					<p>
					  The field of AI, now more than a half a century old, finally achieved some of its oldest goals. 
					  It began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. 
					  Some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems 
					  and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability. 
					  Still, the reputation of AI, in the business world at least, was less than pristine. 
					  Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure 
					  to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. 
					  Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, 
					  sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of "artificial intelligence".
					  AI was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been. 
					</p>
					
<br>
				
<h4> Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence: 2011-present </h4>
				
					<p>
					  In the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as "big data"), 
					  faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. 
					  In fact, McKinsey Global Institute estimated in their famous paper "Big data: 
					  The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity" that "by 2009, 
					  nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data".
					</p>

					<p>
					  By 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than 8 billion dollars, 
					  and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a "frenzy".
					  The applications of big data began to reach into other fields as well, such as training models in ecology
					  and for various applications in economics.
					  Advances in deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) 
					  drove progress and research in image and video processing, text analysis, and even speech recognition.
